# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

On this page, there is a password generator. If the generate
password button is pressed, then the user should get a series of 
prompts outlining the specification of their password. The password
criteria must be between 8 and 128 characters. The prompts will then ask the user if they would like to choose UpperCase letters, LowerCase letters, number, and symbols to add to their password. Based off the selected criteria, the generator will then display a random password that satisfies the selected criteria by the user. 

The random password is generated using various functions in javascript and a series of if/else statements to prompt and confirm user choices.
